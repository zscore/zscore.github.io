1. Corpus_U = Set of all Poems
2. Prosody
3. Vocabulary
4. Syntax
5. Layout
6. Semantic stream

We will roll all typographic marks (carriage returns, hyphens, whitespace, begin/end italics) into our vocabulary and syntax. For instance, we will define a

Weird stuff about poems I like is that there can be layered ambiguity. It's pretty neat when you have a sentence that can be parsed multiple ways.

Let's define a "semantic stream" here, which is the set of thoughts that pass through a person's brain during a given day. Since nearly all communication that a person engages in is modulated through an internet connection, it seems not unreasonable that we can pick up on most conscious thoughts.

Probably the correct objective function here is something that intellectually stimulates a person, i.e., maximizes connections across new pathways. There's this informatic-theoretic idea of "insight generation", which is when somebody finds a new compression of an existing concept whenever their overall hierarchy of knowledge. Of course, not all life can be a continuous stream of resounding insight.
